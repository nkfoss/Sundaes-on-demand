Mock Service Worker

> npm install msw

The MSW's purpose is to intercept network calls and return specified responses. We don't want any network calls
to happen in our tests. We WILL be testing the app's response to our coded mock-response.
There are two main parts: handlers and servers.

## Creating Handlers ##

See the handler.js file... it's essentially just an array of routes and instructions on how to handle them. This is imported and used by the mock server.

## Creating mock server ##

See the ./mocks/server.js file... it's just an exported function that uses the handlers we previously defined.
** NOTE: You also need to make some changes to the setupTests file. Please check it out.


!!! IMPORTANT !!!

Anytime you are doing soemthing asynchronous on the page, you MUST use `await` and `findBy()`.
